## Here are some details about how I integrate my dapp with CyberConnect

1. If user goes to the chats tab, it will first initialize the CyberConnect client.
2. Then a person that we can chat with appears. We have to follow him through CyberConnect first in order to chat with him.
3. The follow action happens in production and on ETH.
4. Details about the implementation is in packages/react-app/src/components/Messages.jsx.
5. CyberConnect SDK is used.
