## Here are some details about how I integrate my dapp with CyberConnect and XMTP

1. If user goes to the chats tab, it will first initialize the XMTP and the CyberConnect client.
2. Then a person that we can chat with appears. We have to follow him through CyberConnect first in order to chat with him.
3. Details about the implementation is in packages/react-app/src/components/Messages.jsx.
